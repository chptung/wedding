          Chris Tung was born on November 28th, 1989, and Alicia Prodromou was born on November 10th, 1988. We met while attending UC Davis where we both worked at the Coffee House. Alicia worked in the espresso bar, and Chris was one of the supervisors. Always friends, Chris hoped for something more and one of his favorite morning routines was making an excuse to help out in the espresso bar to hang out with Alicia. It wouldn't be until after they both graduated where his long game paid off...

          After graduation, Alicia lived and worked in San Francisco, and Chris moved out to New York.
          Chris made a trip out to California in July where a mutual friend brought Alicia and Chris together at 15 Romolo.
          After getting chatting that night, the two continued to talk, and over the course of many gchats, FB messengers, and texts, their love began to blossom.
          They bounced back and forth between the two coasts for almost a year, and the two decided they needed to be in the same place to give this a real chance.
          Alicia took a chance and made the move to New York...

          Harry Potter World, New Orleans, Iceland, London, Amsterdam, Rome, and Scotland. The two grew more in love with each new adventure (and delicious meal).
